            can do during your stay? If you google and think the only things you
            can do here are limited to visiting the

              For most of the hikes, you can just show up on time at the meeting
              points, meet new people or acquaintances, and enjoy the hike. If
              you opt to multi-day adventures, for a reasonable amount of money,
              you can just sign up and those hiking clubs will take care of
              mountain cabin or campsite applications, which is totally hassle
              free. (see <a href="#">4 ways to enjoy hiking in Taiwan</a> for
              details)
            </p>
            <p class="reason-2__p3">
              One of the unique things about those hiking clubs in Taiwan is the
              average age of the hikers is probably in mid 50 years old or even
              older, quite the opposite compared to other countries. Many of
              them are experienced hikers and even have finished
              <a href="#">100 Three-thousanders</a> in Taiwan and it's even
              difficult for younger people to keep up with their pace.
              They are also very welcoming. Some of them even prepare extra
              trail foods, like fresh fruit, iced drinks, etc., which is a big
              delight on the trail.

              Thus, you can find all kinds of registered clubs or companies to
              enjoy those adventures with qualified guides. Since Taiwan is
              small, itâ€™s even better and more convenient for adventure junkies
              to experience as many activities as possible within a short stay.

              7. Wonderful foods for breakfast, lunch and post-hiking meals.
            </h2>
            <p class="reason-7__p1">Last but not least, the food.</br>
              Many breakfast restaurants (it's literally written like that in
              Chinese) open as early as 5am or run business 24 hours, so you can
              stop by to buy foods for your breakfast and lunch. I usually buy
              Fan Tuan, which is made of sticky rice with some fillings like
              fried bread sticks and pork floss, or vegetarian ingredients. Fan
              Tuan is very fulfilling and easy to carry during the hike.

              Or you can bring Ramen with you, and ask whether the guides can
              help you boil hot water. In Taiwan, Ramen is not just for broke
              students. Some expensive ones are with a small meat package
              inside. You can find all kinds of Ramen products at the
              supermarkets, luxuries, cheap, Taiwanese brands, or brands from
              South Asia, South Korea, or Japan.

            As to my favorite post hiking meals, they are fried chicken and
